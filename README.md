=========================================

A tool that allows one to easily replace sprites/other png images from one place in another while also renaming them. Example:

You have two different Minecraft resourcepacks, the one is on 1.20.2 and the other is on 1.7.10. Instead of meticulously renaming and transfering files you're not even sure about, you can use this tool to easily compare both textures, replace one with another and just go to the next textures instead of opening them in photoshop or searching for them in two different folders.

=========================================

The UI is extremely simple:

=========================================

- You have two folder paths. One is for SOURCE sprites, the other is for TARGET sprites. TARGET sprites are the ones you're replacing with SOURCE sprites. Don't mix them up.

- When changing folder path, press refresh to load images.

- You can search for the textures in drop-down menus. There's also autofill on TAB that took me a while to figure out.

- There are 4 buttons below drop-down menus. They're cycling through all sprites one by one.

- The red Replace button makes the replacement of target sprite by source sprite.

- Auto-delete checkbox makes it so when you turn it on, it auto-deletes the source file you've just used to replace the target sprite. Also makes the Replace button darker JUST IN CASE you haven't noticed that the checkbox is on.


*works with .png images only
